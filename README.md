# Python--challenge
Module 3 challenge
This assignment was challenging because it requiredme to use all the knowlegde I have acquired so far in python too arrive at the expected challenge
I relied on helpful websites such as W3school.com, geeksforgeeks.org ans stack overflow to guide me in simplifing my code and understanding certain concepts I had difficulty with.
A challenge I had with the assignment was the part about finding the changes in profit/loss. i expected that for changes to be significantly utilised, the dates must be in chronological order, so that the next day would truly be the chronological next date. I this sorted out my data by the date such that the date colum went from january through to December. However, when I did that, the results i got did not match the expected results as the expected result as done based the mixed dates. I am not ery sure how useful such information would be in real life unless it was just meant to test our ability to apply the skills learnt. I thus psent a lot of time figuring that part out.
As I worked on the assignment, I discovered some simpler ways of getting things done such as opening a new file and I got a better understanding of the return function
